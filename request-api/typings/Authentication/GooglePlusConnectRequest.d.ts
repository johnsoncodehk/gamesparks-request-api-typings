     * Allows either a Google Plus access code or an authentication token to be used as an authentication mechanism.

     * GameSparks will determine the player’s friends and whether any of them are currently registered with the game.
     * If the Google Plus user is already linked to a player, the current session will switch to the linked player.
     * If the current player has previously created an account using either DeviceAuthentictionRequest or RegistrationRequest AND the Google Plus user is not already registered with the game, the Google Plus user will be linked to the current player.
     * If the current player has not authenticated and the Google Plus user is not known, a new player will be created using the Google Plus details and the session will be authenticated against the new player.
     * If the Google Plus user is already known, the session will switch to being the previously created user.
